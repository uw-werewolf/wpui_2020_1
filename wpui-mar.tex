They can ask you more detailed questions about the model in the Q\&A afterwards if they are interested.I like the flow so far and the outputs in slides 6-10.  Although, I think we don't need to show them outputs for this meeting, as it is more of a briefing on WEREWOLF, where we are going with it and inviting them to participate if they are interested.To gather their interest, we should focus on the value proposition for WEREWOLF to help guide government policy and, to some extent, utility investment decisions based on that policy.}\begin{frame}  \frametitle{Werewolf (Wisconsin Expansion of Renewable Electricity with Optimization under Long-term Forecasts)}  \centering  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{includes/timescales.pdf}  \begin{itemize}  \item Design/policy decisions affecting operations/reliability and vice-versa  \item Goal: to help policy and decision makers ...    \begin{itemize}    \item to distinguish between objectives and actions;    \item to understand effects of uncertainty;    \item to understand effects of incentives;    \item to explore larger design space.    \end{itemize}  \end{itemize}\end{frame}\begin{frame}\frametitle{Simplified two-stage stochastic optimization model}\begin{itemize}\item Capacity decisions are $z$ at cost $K(z)$\item Operating decisions: generation $y$ at cost $C(y)$,loadshedding $q$ at cost $Vq$.\item Scenarios (futures) $\omega$, demand (load curve) is $d(\omega)$.\item Minimize capital cost plus expected operating cost:\end{itemize}\begin{center}$%\begin{array}{rrcl}\min & \quad K(z)  & + & \expect_{\omega }[%C(y(\omega )) + Vq(\omega)] \\[1em]\text{s.t.} & \quad\textcolor{black}{y(\omega)} & \textcolor{black}{\leq} & %\textcolor{black}{z} \\& \textcolor{black}{y(\omega) + q(\omega)} & \textcolor{black}{\geq} & %                                                                       \textcolor{black}{d(\omega)}  \\& (z, y, q) & \in & X\end{array}%$\end{center}\begin{itemize}\item WEREWOLF populated using data from Wisconsin: develop the model  for MISO and look at Wisconsin policies in particular\item Data and structure facilitate any US regional model\end{itemize}\end{frame}\begin{frame}  \frametitle{The data}\begin{itemize}  \item WEREWOLF is data rich (EPA NEEDS/Integrated Planning Model, NREL ReEDS model data, NREL Annual Technology Baseline)% I don't know how to make a super nice grid of images here... just putting in the links to images that could go on this slide... needs some help  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{includes/data_offshore_wind.png}\hspace*{0.2in}  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{includes/data_onshore_wind.png}\hspace*{0.2in}  \includegraphics[width=0.25\textwidth]{includes/data_solar.png}  \item Data is downscaled to county level -
