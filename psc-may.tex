They can ask you more detailed questions about the model in the Q\&A afterwards if they are interested.I like the flow so far and the outputs in slides 6-10.  Although, I think we don't need to show them outputs for this meeting, as it is more of a briefing on WEREWOLF, where we are going with it and inviting them to participate if they are interested.To gather their interest, we should focus on the value proposition for WEREWOLF to help guide government policy and, to some extent, utility investment decisions based on that policy.}\begin{frame}  \frametitle{Werewolf (Wisconsin Expansion of Renewable Electricity with Optimization under Long-term Forecasts)}  \centering  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{includes/timescales.pdf}  \begin{itemize}  \item Design/policy decisions affect operations/reliability and vice-versa  \item Goal: to help policy and decision makers ...    \begin{itemize}    \item to distinguish between objectives and actions;    \item to understand effects of uncertainty;    \item to understand effects of incentives;    \item to explore larger design space, \alert{with quick turnaround}    \end{itemize}  \end{itemize}\end{frame}\begin{frame}  \frametitle{Werewolf code}  \begin{itemize}  \item Code is on github  \item Data is adapted from EPA NEEDS/Integrated Planning Model, NREL    ReEDS model data, NREL Annual Technology Baseline and other    sources  \item After data initialization, each run takes XX mins to generate    the following results  \item Show effects of strategies driving towards 100\% carbon free    energy by 2050, coal plant closures, rapid deployment of    renewables, increase in electric vehicle (EV) uptake, for example  \item How could this help with SEA?  \end{itemize}\end{frame}\exclude{Thanks for getting all this up and running.   I have reviewed the slides below (pdf and tex attached) and am commenting only on slides 7 - 12.   I think it would be useful to generate some (modified) stories using your new system like:1) Carbon reductions (with flat imports):   comparison between with and without plant shutdowns  (slide 7 and 9 bottom row).   I would replace the first figure of the three in each line by some kind of cost figure.   I also like the slides detailing the spatial distribution of the up or down take.2) From slide 11, it would be good to do an EV increase in demand.   Maybe some visualization of how that changes demand, and then some figures to tell a story.3) Rapid deployment of wind and solar resources.   Force the model to do more solar and wind (I don’t really know how much) and find out what gets shut down, operated differently.    I don’t know where the solar or wind should be deployed (maybe this would still be up to the model), but forcing a (percentage?) increase in the amounts of these by 2030 of different amounts would be interesting to see what happens to the other things….4) Shut down of non-renewable capacity (as opposed to carbon reduction) a la slide 12.   Some idea of how this affects things would be good.For the appendix, I am wondering if we could do a better job on the data (slide 6).   It might be nice to understand more fully what we have available or how we do the transformations.}% THIS SLIDE SHOWS RESULTS FROM RUNS THAT DID NOT ALLOW SHUTDOWNS\begin{frame}
